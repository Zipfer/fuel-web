1 Install FUEL iso
2 Create evironment
3 Add nodes to environment

The easiest way is to add only one controller and compute node.

4 Download environment(cluster) configuration yaml file:

  $ fuel node
  $ fuel settings --download --env 1

This is command will download settings_1.yaml where the new configuration can be placed.
All new configuration should be placed to the "editable:" section. For example:

 editable:
   custom:
     some_one:
       one: 1
     some_two:
       two: 2
     some_three:
       three: 3

5 Then upload settings back to nailgun:

  $ fuel settings --upload --env 1 --directory /root/

6 The default deployment configuration with custom changes can be downloaded using fuel CLI:

  $ fuel deployment --default --env 1

This command will download yaml files for each nodes.

7 Make chanes for any nodes if needed and upload back:

  $ fuel deployment --upload --env 1

After configuration files are uploaded and deploy is started, all custom
parameters should appear on each nodes in the /etc/astute.yaml.
